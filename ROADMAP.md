# Roadmap

Planned work that has been decided but not built yet.

## Chords

Chord shapes are pitch fractions snapped to the scale, picked from a table ordered by unconventionality, laid out by a
voicing step and led from chord to chord (see `ChordShapes`, `HarmonicUnconventionality`, `ChordVoicing`,
`Render.SnapChordToScale` and `VoiceLeader`). Still to do:

### Jitter on in-between heights

Heights between two qualities, such as the third, could move a little from chord to chord, so that a scale with more
notes than seven picks sometimes one quality and sometimes the other. Worth it once scales of other sizes than seven
exist; in a 7-note scale it changes nothing.

## Form

- **Fade-outs:** an ending that fades over the last section needs channel volume automation, since `Render` spreads the
  notes' velocities over the whole song, so a fade in them would be undone.
- **Intros of their own material,** such as a riff the song does not play otherwise.

## Rhythm engine

A bar pattern's rhythm comes from the dyadic engine (`DyadicRankThresholdPattern`): a cycle (the period) is halved
again and again down to a top rank, and each position is kept by chance by its rank. Most of what fills, busier
melodies and repetition need is a small extension of it rather than a new engine, which keeps its settings and all
the tuning built on them, such as the snare's backbeat and the shares of speed and tuplets. Each step is off by
default, so it can first be shown to leave the recorded songs unchanged, and then tuned by measurement. Built so far:
fullness and repeated cycles (rolls, riffs and pulses), phrase schemes, rhythmic unconventionality, the melody's
rhythm (its busyness, riffs, and phrase ends with a held note and a rest), and fills with landings and a drummer.

### Left for later

- **Motifs within a bar:** a melody's repeated cycle repeats its rhythm, but its pitches follow the rules afresh; a
  motif could be remembered per cycle as well as per bar.

- **Long cycles:** a bar pattern is one bar long, so a slower cycle, such as the kick's slowed to two bars, plays its
  first half and starts again at every bar line. Patterns as long as their cycle would let slow figures run whole, such
  as a crash every two bars or a kick figure answered in the second bar. Worth it if slow figures sound wrong.
- **Segments in any pattern:** bars that mix feels, such as three straight beats and a quintuplet beat; fills get them
  first.
- Choosing whole patterns by measured features (syncopation, evenness) as a family, should a target prove out of reach
  of the dyadic engine; euclidean patterns that fit no cycle; a library of idioms such as clave and bossa;
  energy-aware fills that build into loud sections and break before quiet ones; and drums generated together, the
  snare avoiding the kick and the hi-hat filling the gaps.

A cycle that does not fit the bar and is cut off at the bar line, such as 3+3+2, stays as it is: an off-kilter feel,
not a fault.
